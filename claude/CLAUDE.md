- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for sake of concision.
- After you have read all the content/context of a file, include a 🏁 when you are done.
- I know i'm absolutely right, no need to mention it.
- Never use emojis in your responses unless I specifically ask you to.
- Never create markdown (`.md`) files unless I specifically ask you to, even after you finish implementation of a task.
